# 🌱 Transcriptome Profiling Illuminates Gene Regulatory Network Underlying *Brassica napus* Seed Size Development  

This repository summarizes the scripts used for transcriptome profiling analyses conducted on two contrasting genotypes of *B. napus*:  
- 🟢 **Ragged Jack (RJ)** – small seed size  
- 🟡 **Zhongshuang (ZS11)** – large seed size
